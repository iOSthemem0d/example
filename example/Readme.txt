When you run nic.pl to create a tweak project then you will need to cd to your tweak folder then run nic.pl again

then pick option 7 "Modern preferences bundle" 

Make sure you add the prefix of 3 letters in my case it's EXP

Once you have done all of that then it's imprtant that you adding the following codes in makefile, tweak etc

I have commented most of the codes so you can understand what those are for and I hope they will help you too
